INSERT INTO `book` VALUES (1,'Hamlet','This tale of the immortal Prince of Denmark delves deeply into the complexities of the human soul as it recounts Hamlet\'s tragic struggle to avenge his father\'s death. Books in this new, illustrated series present complete texts of Shakespeare\'s plays. However, the lines are set up so students can see the bard\'s original poetic phrases printed side-by-side and line-by-line with a modern \"translation\" on the facing page. Starting in the late 1580s and for several decades that followed, Shakespeare\'s plays were popular entertainment for London\'s theatergoers. His Globe Theatre was the equivalent of a Broadway theater in today\'s New York. The plays have endured, but over the course of 400+ years, the English language has changed in many ways--which is why today\'s students often find Shakespeare\'s idiom difficult to comprehend. Simply Shakespeare offers an excellent solution to their problem. Introducing each play is a general essay covering Shakespeare\'s life and times. At the beginning of each of the five acts in every play, a two-page spread describes what is about to take place. The story\'s background is explained, followed by brief descriptions of key people who will appear in the act, details students should watch for as the story unfolds, discussion of the play\'s historical context, how the play was staged in Shakespeare\'s day, and explanation of puns and plays on words that occur in characters\' dialogues. Identifying icons preceding each of these study points are printed in a second color, then are located again as cross-references in the play\'s original text. For instance, where words spoken by a person in the play offer insights into his or another character\'s personality, the \"Characters\" icon will appear as a cross-reference in both the introductory spread and the play proper. Following each act, a closing spread presents questions and discussion points for use as teachers\' aids. Guided by the inspiring format of this fine new series, both teachers and students will come to understand and appreciate the genius of Shakespeare as never before.',10,'https://img.thriftbooks.com/api/images/l/9dfc64b690179b709261fd39e4f8a95f0b017fb9.jpg',120000,120,_binary '',2),(2,'If I Stay','The critically acclaimed, bestselling novel from Gayle Forman, author of Where She Went, Just One Day, and Just One Year.

A devastating new weapon of destruction. An unthinkable target. When world-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to his first assignment to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious symbol -- seared into the chest of a murdered physicist -- he discovers evidence of the unimaginable: the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati...the most powerful underground organization ever to walk the earth. The Illuminati has now surfaced to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy -- the Catholic Church. Langdon\'s worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the Vatican\'s holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces they have hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival. Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year-old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair...a clandestine location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation. Critics have praised the exhilarating blend of relentless adventure, scholarly intrigue, and cutting wit found in Brown\'s remarkable thrillers featuring Robert Langdon. An explosive international suspense, Angels & Demons marks this hero\'s first adventure as it careens from enlightening epiphanies to dark truths as the battle between science and religion turns to war.',15,'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ecr94gwyL._SL300_.jpg',130000,220,_binary '',2);
