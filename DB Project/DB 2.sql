INSERT INTO `book` VALUES (1,'Hamlet','This tale of the immortal Prince of Denmark delves deeply into the complexities of the human soul as it recounts Hamlet\'s tragic struggle to avenge his father\'s death. Books in this new, illustrated series present complete texts of Shakespeare\'s plays. However, the lines are set up so students can see the bard\'s original poetic phrases printed side-by-side and line-by-line with a modern \"translation\" on the facing page. Starting in the late 1580s and for several decades that followed, Shakespeare\'s plays were popular entertainment for London\'s theatergoers. His Globe Theatre was the equivalent of a Broadway theater in today\'s New York. The plays have endured, but over the course of 400+ years, the English language has changed in many ways--which is why today\'s students often find Shakespeare\'s idiom difficult to comprehend. Simply Shakespeare offers an excellent solution to their problem. Introducing each play is a general essay covering Shakespeare\'s life and times. At the beginning of each of the five acts in every play, a two-page spread describes what is about to take place. The story\'s background is explained, followed by brief descriptions of key people who will appear in the act, details students should watch for as the story unfolds, discussion of the play\'s historical context, how the play was staged in Shakespeare\'s day, and explanation of puns and plays on words that occur in characters\' dialogues. Identifying icons preceding each of these study points are printed in a second color, then are located again as cross-references in the play\'s original text. For instance, where words spoken by a person in the play offer insights into his or another character\'s personality, the \"Characters\" icon will appear as a cross-reference in both the introductory spread and the play proper. Following each act, a closing spread presents questions and discussion points for use as teachers\' aids. Guided by the inspiring format of this fine new series, both teachers and students will come to understand and appreciate the genius of Shakespeare as never before.',10,'https://img.thriftbooks.com/api/images/l/9dfc64b690179b709261fd39e4f8a95f0b017fb9.jpg',120000,120,_binary '',2),(2,'If I Stay','The critically acclaimed, bestselling novel from Gayle Forman, author of Where She Went, Just One Day, and Just One Year.

A devastating new weapon of destruction. An unthinkable target. When world-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to his first assignment to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious symbol -- seared into the chest of a murdered physicist -- he discovers evidence of the unimaginable: the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati...the most powerful underground organization ever to walk the earth. The Illuminati has now surfaced to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy -- the Catholic Church. Langdon\'s worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the Vatican\'s holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces they have hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival. Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year-old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair...a clandestine location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation. Critics have praised the exhilarating blend of relentless adventure, scholarly intrigue, and cutting wit found in Brown\'s remarkable thrillers featuring Robert Langdon. An explosive international suspense, Angels & Demons marks this hero\'s first adventure as it careens from enlightening epiphanies to dark truths as the battle between science and religion turns to war.',15,'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ecr94gwyL._SL300_.jpg',130000,220,_binary '',2),(11,'Bram Stoker\'s Dracula','Not for the faint of heart!

As a former slave, impassioned abolitionist, gifted writer, newspaper editor, and powerful orator, Douglass was an immense, motivational figure. His early life, filled with physical abuse, deprivation, and tragedy, adds up to a heart-wrenching history. However, he was able to overcome everything that bound a slave to his life and become a leading spokesman for his people. In this first of his three autobiographies, Douglass relates graphic descriptions of his childhood, his shocking experiences as a slave, and his thrilling escape from slavery to safety in the North and his pivotal freedom. Originally published in 1845, a date significant for the fact that very few African Americans could read or write at that time, this tale of sadness, danger, and eventual liberation will appeal to readers of all kinds.

This sudden death inspires an emotional odysseyâfirst to a small town in Kansas, from which he retraces the migration of his motherâs family to Hawaii, and then to Kenya, where he meets the African side of his family, confronts the bitter truth of his fatherâs life, and at last reconciles his divided inheritance.

Celebrating the 20th anniversary of the book that launched James McBride\'s literary career Over two years on The New York Times bestseller list Who is Ruth McBride Jordan? A self-declared \"light-skinned\" woman evasive about her ethnicity, yet steadfast in her love for her twelve black children. James McBride, journalist, musician, and son, explores his mother\'s past, as well as his own upbringing and heritage, in a poignant and powerful debut, The Color Of Water: A Black Man\'s Tribute to His White Mother . The son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white, James McBride grew up in \"orchestrated chaos\" with his eleven siblings in the poor, all-black projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn. \"Mommy,\" a fiercely protective woman with \"dark eyes full of pep and fire,\" herded her brood to Manhattan\'s free cultural events, sent them off on buses to the best (and mainly Jewish) schools, demanded good grades, and commanded respect. As a young man, McBride saw his mother as a source of embarrassment, worry, and confusion and reached thirty before he began to discover the truth about her early life and long-buried pain. In The Color of Water , McBride retraces his mother\'s footsteps and, through her searing and spirited voice, recreates her remarkable story. The daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi, she was born Rachel Shilsky (actually Ruchel Dwara Zylska) in Poland on April 1, 1921. Fleeing pogroms, her family emigrated to America and ultimately settled in Suffolk, Virginia, a small town where anti-Semitism and racial tensions ran high. With candor and immediacy, Ruth describes her parents\' loveless marriage; her fragile, handicapped mother; her cruel, sexually-abusive father; and the rest of the family and life she abandoned. At seventeen, after fleeing Virginia and settling in New York City, Ruth married a black minister and founded the all- black New Brown Memorial Baptist Church in her Red Hook living room. \"God is the color of water,\" Ruth McBride taught her children, firmly convinced that life\'s blessings and life\'s values transcend race. Twice widowed, and continually confronting overwhelming adversity and racism, Ruth\'s determination, drive and discipline saw her dozen children through college and most through graduate school. At age 65, she herself received a degree in social work from Temple University. Interspersed throughout his mother\'s compelling narrative, McBride shares candid recollections of his own experiences as a mixed-race child of poverty, his flirtations with drugs and violence, and his eventual self- realization and professional success. The Color of Water touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son. \"',5,'https://img.thriftbooks.com/api/images/l/95b2cf3cff3c2e145aa914afe4333c41d8adc13f.jpg',100000,0,_binary '\0',3),(16,'The Investment Answer : Learn to Manage Your Money and Protect Your Financial Future','What if there were a way to cut through all the financial mumbo-jumbo?

Tax policies and their enforcement have become a disaster, and thanks to discreet lobbying by a segment of the top 1 percent, Washington is reluctant or unable to fix them. The corporate income tax, the estate tax, and the gift tax have been largely ignored by the media. But the cumulative results are remarkable: today someone who earns a yearly salary of $60,000 pays a larger percentage of his income in taxes than the four hundred richest Americans. Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter David Cay Johnston exposes exactly how the middle class is being squeezed to create a widening wealth gap that threatens the stability of the country. By relating the compelling tales of real people across all areas of society, he reveals the truth behind: \"Middle class\" tax cuts and exactly whom they benefit. How workers are being cheated out of their retirement plans while disgraced CEOs walk away with millions. How some corporations avoid paying any federal income tax. How a law meant to prevent cheating by the top 2 percent of Americans no longer affects most of them, but has morphed into a stealth tax on single mothers making just $28,000. Why the working poor are seven times more likely to be audited by the IRS than everyone else. How the IRS became so weak that even when it was handed complete banking records detailing massive cheating by 1,600 people, it prosecuted only 4 percent of them. Johnston has been breaking pieces of this story on the front page of The New York Times for seven years. With Perfectly Legal , he puts the whole shocking narrative together in a way that will stir up media attention and make readers angry about the state of our country.',12,'https://img.thriftbooks.com/api/images/l/39d63e488e52074b10126bacde3b89d9f8aa8300.jpg',100000,100,_binary '',4),(25,'Intermediate Accounting','The bestselling book on intermediate accounting, Kieso is an excellent reference for practicing accountants and an invaluable resource for anyone entering the field.

In Sway, renowned organizational thinker Ori Brafman and his brother, psychologist Rom Brafman, answer all these questions and more.Drawing on cutting-edge research from the fields of social psychology, behavioral economics, and organizational behavior, Sway reveals dynamic forces that influence every aspect of our personal and business lives, including loss aversion (our tendency to go to great lengths to avoid perceived losses), the diagnosis bias (our inability to reevaluate our initial diagnosis of a person or situation), and the âchameleon effectâ (our tendency to take on characteristics that have been arbitrarily assigned to us). Sway introduces us to the Harvard Business School professor who got his students to pay $204 for a $20 bill, the head of airline safety whose disregard for his years of training led to the transformation of an entire industry, and the football coach who turned conventional strategy on its head to lead his team to victory. We also learn the curse of the NBA draft, discover why interviews are a terrible way to gauge future job performance, and go inside a session with the Supreme Court to see how the worldâs most powerful justices avoid the dangers of group dynamics.Every once in a while, a book comes along that not only challenges our views of the world but changes the way we think.
